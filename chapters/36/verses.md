يس ﴿١﴾ وَالْقُرْآنِ الْحَكِيمِ ﴿٢﴾ إِنَّكَ لَمِنَ الْمُرْسَلِينَ ﴿٣﴾ عَلَىٰ صِرَاطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ ﴿٤﴾ تَنزِيلَ الْعَزِيزِ الرَّحِيمِ ﴿٥﴾ لِتُنذِرَ قَوْمًا مَّا أُنذِرَ آبَاؤُهُمْ فَهُمْ غَافِلُونَ ﴿٦﴾ لَقَدْ حَقَّ الْقَوْلُ عَلَىٰ أَكْثَرِهِمْ فَهُمْ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ ﴿٧﴾ إِنَّا جَعَلْنَا فِي أَعْنَاقِهِمْ أَغْلَالًا فَهِيَ إِلَى الْأَذْقَانِ فَهُم مُّقْمَحُونَ ﴿٨﴾ وَجَعَلْنَا مِن بَيْنِ أَيْدِيهِمْ سَدًّا وَمِنْ خَلْفِهِمْ سَدًّا فَأَغْشَيْنَاهُمْ فَهُمْ لَا يُبْصِرُونَ ﴿٩﴾ وَسَوَاءٌ عَلَيْهِمْ أَأَنذَرْتَهُمْ أَمْ لَمْ تُنذِرْهُمْ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ ﴿١٠﴾ إِنَّمَا تُنذِرُ مَنِ اتَّبَعَ الذِّكْرَ وَخَشِيَ الرَّحْمَٰنَ بِالْغَيْبِ ۖ فَبَشِّرْهُ بِمَغْفِرَةٍ وَأَجْرٍ كَرِيمٍ ﴿١١﴾ إِنَّا نَحْنُ نُحْيِي الْمَوْتَىٰ وَنَكْتُبُ مَا قَدَّمُوا وَآثَارَهُمْ ۚ وَكُلَّ شَيْءٍ أَحْصَيْنَاهُ فِي إِمَامٍ مُّبِينٍ ﴿١٢﴾

### English Translation
1. Ya Sin.
2. By the wise Qur'an.
3. Indeed you, [O Muhammad], are among the messengers,
4. On a straight path.
5. [This is] a revelation of the Exalted in Might, the Merciful,
6. That you may warn a people whose forefathers were not warned, so they are unaware.
7. Already the word has come into effect upon most of them, so they do not believe.
8. Indeed, We have put shackles on their necks, and they are to their chins, so they are with heads [kept] aloft.
9. And We have put before them a barrier and behind them a barrier and covered them, so they do not see.
10. And it is all the same for them whether you warn them or do not warn them - they will not believe.
11. You can only warn one who follows the message and fears the Most Merciful unseen. So give him good tidings of forgiveness and noble reward.
12. Indeed, it is We who bring the dead to life and record what they have put forth and what they left behind, and all things We have enumerated in a clear register.

### Commentary
These opening verses establish several key themes. The chapter begins with the Arabic letters "Ya Sin," one of the mysterious letter combinations in the Quran. Allah swears by the Quran, affirming its wisdom and Muhammad's position as a messenger on the straight path. The purpose of revelation is defined: to warn people whose ancestors were not warned. 

The verses then describe those who reject faith as having spiritual barriers that prevent them from perceiving truth - symbolized by shackles on their necks and barriers before and behind them. This represents their stubborn refusal to accept guidance. Verse 10 indicates that for such people, warning will not benefit them.

The focus then shifts to those who will benefit from the warning: those who follow Allah's reminder and fear Him without seeing Him. For them, there is forgiveness and reward. The section concludes with an affirmation of Allah's power to resurrect the dead and His complete knowledge of all that people do, emphasizing that everything is recorded in a clear register.

وَاضْرِبْ لَهُم مَّثَلًا أَصْحَابَ الْقَرْيَةِ إِذْ جَاءَهَا الْمُرْسَلُونَ ﴿١٣﴾ إِذْ أَرْسَلْنَا إِلَيْهِمُ اثْنَيْنِ فَكَذَّبُوهُمَا فَعَزَّزْنَا بِثَالِثٍ فَقَالُوا إِنَّا إِلَيْكُم مُّرْسَلُونَ ﴿١٤﴾ قَالُوا مَا أَنتُمْ إِلَّا بَشَرٌ مِّثْلُنَا وَمَا أَنزَلَ الرَّحْمَٰنُ مِن شَيْءٍ إِنْ أَنتُمْ إِلَّا تَكْذِبُونَ ﴿١٥﴾ قَالُوا رَبُّنَا يَعْلَمُ إِنَّا إِلَيْكُمْ لَمُرْسَلُونَ ﴿١٦﴾ وَمَا عَلَيْنَا إِلَّا الْبَلَاغُ الْمُبِينُ ﴿١٧﴾ قَالُوا إِنَّا تَطَيَّرْنَا بِكُمْ ۖ لَئِن لَّمْ تَنتَهُوا لَنَرْجُمَنَّكُمْ وَلَيَمَسَّنَّكُم مِّنَّا عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ ﴿١٨﴾ قَالُوا طَائِرُكُم مَّعَكُمْ ۚ أَئِن ذُكِّرْتُم ۚ بَلْ أَنتُمْ قَوْمٌ مُّسْرِفُونَ ﴿١٩﴾ وَجَاءَ مِنْ أَقْصَى الْمَدِينَةِ رَجُلٌ يَسْعَىٰ قَالَ يَا قَوْمِ اتَّبِعُوا الْمُرْسَلِينَ ﴿٢٠﴾ اتَّبِعُوا مَن لَّا يَسْأَلُكُمْ أَجْرًا وَهُم مُّهْتَدُونَ ﴿٢١﴾ وَمَا لِيَ لَا أَعْبُدُ الَّذِي فَطَرَنِي وَإِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ ﴿٢٢﴾ أَأَتَّخِذُ مِن دُونِهِ آلِهَةً إِن يُرِدْنِ الرَّحْمَٰنُ بِضُرٍّ لَّا تُغْنِ عَنِّي شَفَاعَتُهُمْ شَيْئًا وَلَا يُنقِذُونِ ﴿٢٣﴾ إِنِّي إِذًا لَّفِي ضَلَالٍ مُّبِينٍ ﴿٢٤﴾ إِنِّي آمَنتُ بِرَبِّكُمْ فَاسْمَعُونِ ﴿٢٥﴾ قِيلَ ادْخُلِ الْجَنَّةَ ۖ قَالَ يَا لَيْتَ قَوْمِي يَعْلَمُونَ ﴿٢٦﴾ بِمَا غَفَرَ لِي رَبِّي وَجَعَلَنِي مِنَ الْمُكْرَمِينَ ﴿٢٧﴾ وَمَا أَنزَلْنَا عَلَىٰ قَوْمِهِ مِن بَعْدِهِ مِن جُندٍ مِّنَ السَّمَاءِ وَمَا كُنَّا مُنزِلِينَ ﴿٢٨﴾ إِن كَانَتْ إِلَّا صَيْحَةً وَاحِدَةً فَإِذَا هُمْ خَامِدُونَ ﴿٢٩﴾ يَا حَسْرَةً عَلَى الْعِبَادِ ۚ مَا يَأْتِيهِم مِّن رَّسُولٍ إِلَّا كَانُوا بِهِ يَسْتَهْزِئُونَ ﴿٣٠﴾ أَلَمْ يَرَوْا كَمْ أَهْلَكْنَا قَبْلَهُم مِّنَ الْقُرُونِ أَنَّهُمْ إِلَيْهِمْ لَا يَرْجِعُونَ ﴿٣١﴾ وَإِن كُلٌّ لَّمَّا جَمِيعٌ لَّدَيْنَا مُحْضَرُونَ ﴿٣٢﴾

### English Translation
13. And present to them an example: the people of the city, when the messengers came to it -
14. When We sent to them two but they denied them, so We strengthened them with a third, and they said, "Indeed, we are messengers to you."
15. They said, "You are not but human beings like us, and the Most Merciful has not revealed a thing. You are only telling lies."
16. They said, "Our Lord knows that we are messengers to you,
17. And we are not responsible except for clear notification."
18. They said, "Indeed, we consider you a bad omen. If you do not desist, we will surely stone you, and there will surely touch you, from us, a painful punishment."
19. They said, "Your omen is with yourselves. Is it because you were reminded? Rather, you are a transgressing people."
20. And there came from the farthest end of the city a man, running. He said, "O my people, follow the messengers.
21. Follow those who do not ask of you [any] payment, and they are [rightly] guided.
22. And why should I not worship He who created me and to whom you will be returned?
23. Should I take other than Him [false] deities [while], if the Most Merciful intends for me some adversity, their intercession will not avail me at all, nor can they save me?
24. Indeed, I would then be in manifest error.
25. Indeed, I have believed in your Lord, so listen to me."
26. It was said, "Enter Paradise." He said, "I wish my people could know
27. Of how my Lord has forgiven me and placed me among the honored."
28. And We did not send down upon his people after him any soldiers from the heaven, nor would We have done so.
29. It was not but one shout, and immediately they were extinguished.
30. How regrettable for the servants. There did not come to them any messenger except that they used to ridicule him.
31. Have they not considered how many generations We destroyed before them - that they to them will not return?
32. And indeed, all of them will yet be brought present before Us.

### Commentary
This section presents the parable of the people of the city (traditionally understood to be Antioch) who rejected the messengers sent to them. Initially, two messengers were sent, but when rejected, a third was added to strengthen their mission. The townspeople rejected them on the basis that they were merely human beings like themselves.

The messengers affirmed that they were only responsible for clearly delivering the message. When threatened with stoning and punishment, they responded that the people's misfortune was due to their own rejection of truth, not because of the messengers.

The narrative then introduces a believing man who came from the farthest part of the city (traditionally known as Habib an-Najjar). This man urged his people to follow the messengers who asked for no payment and were rightly guided. He questioned why he should not worship the Creator to whom everyone will return, pointing out the futility of worshipping false deities that could not help in times of adversity.

After declaring his faith, the man was killed (implied but not explicitly stated in the text) and entered Paradise. His wish was that his people would know of Allah's forgiveness and honor bestowed upon him. The city's people were then destroyed by a single shout, showing the ease with which Allah can punish those who reject His messengers.

The passage concludes with a reflection on how people mockingly reject messengers and a reminder of how many previous generations have been destroyed for similar rejection. All will ultimately be brought before Allah.

### English Translation
33. And a sign for them is the dead earth. We have brought it to life and brought forth from it grain, and from it they eat.
34. And We placed therein gardens of palm trees and grapevines and caused to burst forth therefrom some springs -
35. That they may eat of His fruit. And their hands have not produced it, so will they not be grateful?
36. Exalted is He who created all pairs - from what the earth grows and from themselves and from that which they do not know.
37. And a sign for them is the night. We remove from it the [light of] day, so they are [left] in darkness.
38. And the sun runs [on course] toward its stopping point. That is the determination of the Exalted in Might, the Knowing.
39. And the moon - We have determined for it phases, until it returns [appearing] like the old date stalk.
40. It is not allowable for the sun to reach the moon, nor does the night overtake the day, but each, in an orbit, is swimming.
41. And a sign for them is that We carried their forefathers in a laden ship.
42. And We created for them from the likes of it that which they ride.
43. And if We should will, We could drown them; then no one responding to a cry would there be for them, nor would they be saved
44. Except as a mercy from Us and provision for a time.
45. But when it is said to them, "Beware of what is before you and what is behind you; perhaps you will receive mercy..."
46. And no sign comes to them from the signs of their Lord except that they turn away therefrom.
47. And when it is said to them, "Spend from that which Allah has provided for you," those who disbelieve say to those who believe, "Should we feed one whom, if Allah had willed, He would have fed? You are not but in clear error."
48. And they say, "When is this promise, if you should be truthful?"
49. They do not await except one blast which will seize them while they are disputing.
50. And they will not be able to give any instruction, nor to their people can they return.

### Commentary
This section shifts to presenting natural signs that point to Allah's existence and power. The first sign is the revival of dead earth through rain, producing grain for sustenance, as well as gardens and springs. The fact that humans didn't create these provisions should inspire gratitude.

Verse 36 highlights Allah's creation of all things in pairs, including plants, humans, and things unknown to us. The alternation of night and day is presented as another sign, with darkness emerging when light is removed. 

The sun and moon are described as moving in their ordained courses - the sun toward its stopping point (either daily setting or its final destination), and the moon through its phases until it becomes thin like an old date stalk. Each celestial body follows its own orbit, never interfering with the other.

The passage then mentions ships as a sign of Allah's mercy, both the ark that carried previous generations and similar vessels created for contemporary travel. These could be destroyed at Allah's will, but He provides them as mercy and provision for a time.

Despite these signs and warnings to be mindful of consequences, disbelievers turn away from Allah's signs. When encouraged to spend from what Allah has provided, they mockingly question why they should feed those whom "Allah could feed if He wished," showing their misunderstanding of human responsibility.

The disbelievers challenge believers about when the promised judgment will come. The response is that it will come suddenly as a single blast while they are engaged in disputes, leaving no time for last instructions or returning to their families.

### English Translation
51. And the Horn will be blown; and at once from the graves to their Lord they will hasten.
52. They will say, "O woe to us! Who has raised us up from our sleeping place?" [The reply will be], "This is what the Most Merciful had promised, and the messengers told the truth."
53. It will not be but one blast, and at once they are all brought present before Us.
54. So today no soul will be wronged at all, and you will not be recompensed except for what you used to do.
55. Indeed the companions of Paradise, that Day, will be amused in [joyful] occupation -
56. They and their spouses - in shade, reclining on adorned couches.
57. They will have therein fruits, and they will have whatever they request.
58. [And] "Peace," a word from a Merciful Lord.
59. [Then He will say], "But stand apart today, you criminals.
60. Did I not enjoin upon you, O children of Adam, that you not worship Satan - [for] indeed, he is to you a clear enemy -
61. And that you worship [only] Me? This is a straight path.
62. And he had already led astray from among you much of creation, so did you not use reason?
63. This is the Hellfire which you were promised.
64. [Enter to] burn therein today for what you used to deny."
65. That Day, We will seal over their mouths, and their hands will speak to Us, and their feet will testify about what they used to earn.
66. And if We willed, We could have obliterated their eyes, and they would race to [find] the path, and how could they see?
67. And if We willed, We could have deformed them, [paralyzing them] in their places so they would not be able to proceed, nor could they return.
68. And he to whom We grant long life We reverse in creation; so will they not understand?
69. And We did not give Prophet Muhammad, knowledge of poetry, nor is it befitting for him. It is not but a message and a clear Qur'an
70. To warn whoever is alive and justify the word against the disbelievers.

### Commentary
This section describes the Day of Resurrection in vivid detail. It begins with the blowing of the Horn, after which people will rise from their graves and hasten to their Lord. In their confusion, they will wonder who has raised them from their "sleep" (death), only to realize that this is exactly what Allah and His messengers had promised.

The resurrection will occur with a single blast, after which all will be brought before Allah for judgment. The judgment will be completely fair - no soul will be wronged, and each will receive exactly what they deserve based on their deeds.

The passage then contrasts the fate of the believers and disbelievers. The companions of Paradise will be joyfully occupied, accompanied by their spouses, reclining on adorned couches in the shade. They will have fruits and whatever else they desire, along with peace from their Merciful Lord.

In contrast, the criminals will be separated. Allah will remind them that He had warned them not to worship Satan, their clear enemy, but to worship Allah alone - the straight path. Despite Satan leading many astray, they failed to use reason. They will be told to enter Hellfire as a consequence of their denial.

On that Day, Allah will seal their mouths, but their hands will speak and their feet will testify about what they did. The passage reminds that Allah could have blinded or deformed them in this world, making them unable to move forward or backward, but He didn't. The aging process, in which the strong become weak, is presented as a sign for reflection.

The section concludes with a clarification that Muhammad was not taught poetry, nor was it appropriate for him. The Quran is a clear message to warn the living and establish the case against disbelievers.

أَوَلَمْ يَرَوْا أَنَّا خَلَقْنَا لَهُم مِّمَّا عَمِلَتْ أَيْدِينَا أَنْعَامًا فَهُمْ لَهَا مَالِكُونَ ﴿٧١﴾ وَذَلَّلْنَاهَا لَهُمْ فَمِنْهَا رَكُوبُهُمْ وَمِنْهَا يَأْكُلُونَ ﴿٧٢﴾ وَلَهُمْ فِيهَا مَنَافِعُ وَمَشَارِبُ ۖ أَفَلَا يَشْكُرُونَ ﴿٧٣﴾ وَاتَّخَذُوا مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ آلِهَةً لَّعَلَّهُمْ يُنصَرُونَ ﴿٧٤﴾ لَا يَسْتَطِيعُونَ نَصْرَهُمْ وَهُمْ لَهُمْ جُندٌ مُّحْضَرُونَ ﴿٧٥﴾ فَلَا يَحْزُنكَ قَوْلُهُمْ ۘ إِنَّا نَعْلَمُ مَا يُسِرُّونَ وَمَا يُعْلِنُونَ ﴿٧٦﴾ أَوَلَمْ يَرَ الْإِنسَانُ أَنَّا خَلَقْنَاهُ مِن نُّطْفَةٍ فَإِذَا هُوَ خَصِيمٌ مُّبِينٌ ﴿٧٧﴾ وَضَرَبَ لَنَا مَثَلًا وَنَسِيَ خَلْقَهُ ۖ قَالَ مَن يُحْيِي الْعِظَامَ وَهِيَ رَمِيمٌ ﴿٧٨﴾ قُلْ يُحْيِيهَا الَّذِي أَنشَأَهَا أَوَّلَ مَرَّةٍ ۖ وَهُوَ بِكُلِّ خَلْقٍ عَلِيمٌ ﴿٧٩﴾ الَّذِي جَعَلَ لَكُم مِّنَ الشَّجَرِ الْأَخْضَرِ نَارًا فَإِذَا أَنتُم مِّنْهُ تُوقِدُونَ ﴿٨٠﴾ أَوَلَيْسَ الَّذِي خَلَقَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ بِقَادِرٍ عَلَىٰ أَن يَخْلُقَ مِثْلَهُم ۚ بَلَىٰ وَهُوَ الْخَلَّاقُ الْعَلِيمُ ﴿٨١﴾ إِنَّمَا أَمْرُهُ إِذَا أَرَادَ شَيْئًا أَن يَقُولَ لَهُ كُن فَيَكُونُ ﴿٨٢﴾ فَسُبْحَانَ الَّذِي بِيَدِهِ مَلَكُوتُ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ وَإِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ ﴿٨٣﴾

### English Translation
71. Do they not see that We have created for them from what Our hands have made, grazing livestock, and [then] they are their owners?
72. And We have tamed them for them, so some of them they ride, and some of them they eat.
73. And for them therein are [other] benefits and drinks, so will they not be grateful?
74. But they have taken besides Allah [false] deities that perhaps they would be helped.
75. They are not able to help them, and they [themselves] are for them soldiers in attendance.
76. So let not their speech grieve you. Indeed, We know what they conceal and what they declare.
77. Does man not consider that We created him from a [mere] sperm-drop - then at once he is a clear adversary?
78. And he presents for Us an example and forgets his [own] creation. He says, "Who will give life to bones while they are disintegrated?"
79. Say, "He will give them life who produced them the first time; and He is, of all creation, Knowing."
80. [It is] He who made for you from the green tree, fire, and then from it you ignite.
81. Is not He who created the heavens and the earth Able to create the likes of them? Yes, [it is so]; and He is the Knowing Creator.
82. His command is only when He intends a thing that He says to it, "Be," and it is.
83. So exalted is He in whose hand is the realm of all things, and to Him you will be returned.

### Commentary
This final section presents additional proofs of Allah's power and further arguments for the resurrection. It starts by pointing to livestock that Allah created and made subservient to humans - they ride some and eat others, and derive various benefits from them. Despite these blessings, people aren't grateful and instead worship false deities that cannot help them.

The Prophet is consoled not to be grieved by the disbelievers' speech, as Allah knows what they conceal and what they reveal. 

The passage then addresses human origin and resurrection. People who argue against resurrection forget their own humble beginning from a mere sperm-drop, yet they become clear adversaries. They question how Allah could resurrect disintegrated bones, forgetting that the One who created them initially can easily recreate them. Allah knows all about His creation.

Another sign of Allah's power is His ability to produce fire from green trees (referring to the Arabian practice of producing fire by rubbing two green branches together). If Allah can create such opposites (fire from what is wet and green), He can certainly resurrect the dead.

The chapter concludes with powerful statements about Allah's ability. The One who created the heavens and earth can certainly recreate humans. His command is simple - when He intends something, He merely says "Be," and it is. The final verse glorifies Allah, in whose hand is the dominion of all things, and reminds that to Him all will return.
