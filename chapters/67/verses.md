# Verses of Surah Al-Mulk (Chapter 67)

## Verses 1-5: Allah's Sovereignty and Perfect Creation

### Arabic
تَبَارَكَ الَّذِي بِيَدِهِ الْمُلْكُ وَهُوَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ ﴿١﴾ الَّذِي خَلَقَ الْمَوْتَ وَالْحَيَاةَ لِيَبْلُوَكُمْ أَيُّكُمْ أَحْسَنُ عَمَلًا ۚ وَهُوَ الْعَزِيزُ الْغَفُورُ ﴿٢﴾ الَّذِي خَلَقَ سَبْعَ سَمَاوَاتٍ طِبَاقًا ۖ مَّا تَرَىٰ فِي خَلْقِ الرَّحْمَٰنِ مِن تَفَاوُتٍ ۖ فَارْجِعِ الْبَصَرَ هَلْ تَرَىٰ مِن فُطُورٍ ﴿٣﴾ ثُمَّ ارْجِعِ الْبَصَرَ كَرَّتَيْنِ يَنقَلِبْ إِلَيْكَ الْبَصَرُ خَاسِئًا وَهُوَ حَسِيرٌ ﴿٤﴾ وَلَقَدْ زَيَّنَّا السَّمَاءَ الدُّنْيَا بِمَصَابِيحَ وَجَعَلْنَاهَا رُجُومًا لِّلشَّيَاطِينِ ۖ وَأَعْتَدْنَا لَهُمْ عَذَابَ السَّعِيرِ ﴿٥﴾

### Transliteration
1. Tabārakal-ladhī biyadihil-mulku wa Huwa 'alā kulli shay'in Qadīr
2. Alladhī khalaqal-mawta wal-ḥayāta liyabluwakum ayyukum aḥsanu 'amalā, wa Huwal-'Azīzul-Ghafūr
3. Alladhī khalaqa sab'a samāwātin ṭibāqā, mā tarā fī khalqir-Raḥmāni min tafāwut, farji'il-baṣara hal tarā min fuṭūr
4. Thummarji'il-baṣara karratayni yanqalib ilaykal-baṣaru khāsi'anw-wa huwa ḥasīr
5. Wa laqad zayyannās-samā'ad-dunyā bimaṣābīḥa wa ja'alnāhā rujūmal-lish-shayāṭīni wa a'tadnā lahum 'adhābas-sa'īr

### English Translation
1. Blessed is He in whose hand is dominion, and He is over all things competent -
2. [He] who created death and life to test you [as to] which of you is best in deed - and He is the Exalted in Might, the Forgiving -
3. [And] who created seven heavens in layers. You do not see in the creation of the Most Merciful any inconsistency. So return [your] vision [to the sky]; do you see any breaks?
4. Then return [your] vision twice again. [Your] vision will return to you humbled while it is fatigued.
5. And We have certainly beautified the nearest heaven with lamps, and We have made [from] them what is thrown at the devils and have prepared for them the punishment of the Blaze.

### Commentary
The surah begins with "Tabāraka" (Blessed is He), immediately establishing the theme of Allah's supreme power and exalted status. The first verse declares Allah's absolute sovereignty (mulk) over all creation and His unlimited power over everything.

Verse 2 introduces a profound theological concept: Allah created both death and life as a test to see who excels in good deeds. This establishes the purpose of human existence - not merely to live, but to strive for excellence in actions. The verse concludes by pairing Allah's might ('Azīz) with His forgiveness (Ghafūr), balancing the attributes of power and mercy.

Verses 3-4 highlight the perfection of Allah's creation, specifically the seven heavens created in layers. The listener/reader is invited to inspect the sky repeatedly for any flaws or imperfections. The result of this scrutiny is that one's vision returns "humbled and fatigued," unable to detect any imperfection in Allah's creation. This serves as evidence of divine design and precision.

Verse 5 describes how Allah adorned the nearest heaven (the visible sky) with "lamps" (stars), which also serve as projectiles against devils. This dual purpose of celestial bodies - beautification and protection - demonstrates Allah's wisdom in creation.

The opening passage thus establishes the majesty of Allah through His perfect sovereignty, purposeful creation, and flawless design of the universe.

## Verses 6-11: The Fate of Disbelievers

### Arabic
وَلِلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا بِرَبِّهِمْ عَذَابُ جَهَنَّمَ ۖ وَبِئْسَ الْمَصِيرُ ﴿٦﴾ إِذَا أُلْقُوا فِيهَا سَمِعُوا لَهَا شَهِيقًا وَهِيَ تَفُورُ ﴿٧﴾ تَكَادُ تَمَيَّزُ مِنَ الْغَيْظِ ۖ كُلَّمَا أُلْقِيَ فِيهَا فَوْجٌ سَأَلَهُمْ خَزَنَتُهَا أَلَمْ يَأْتِكُمْ نَذِيرٌ ﴿٨﴾ قَالُوا بَلَىٰ قَدْ جَاءَنَا نَذِيرٌ فَكَذَّبْنَا وَقُلْنَا مَا نَزَّلَ اللَّهُ مِن شَيْءٍ إِنْ أَنتُمْ إِلَّا فِي ضَلَالٍ كَبِيرٍ ﴿٩﴾ وَقَالُوا لَوْ كُنَّا نَسْمَعُ أَوْ نَعْقِلُ مَا كُنَّا فِي أَصْحَابِ السَّعِيرِ ﴿١٠﴾ فَاعْتَرَفُوا بِذَنبِهِمْ فَسُحْقًا لِّأَصْحَابِ السَّعِيرِ ﴿١١﴾

### Transliteration
6. Wa lilladhīna kafarū bi-Rabbihim 'adhābu jahannama wa bi'sal-maṣīr
7. Idhā ulqū fīhā sami'ū lahā shahīqanw-wa hiya tafūr
8. Takādu tamayyazu minal-ghayẓ, kullamā ulqiya fīhā fawjun sa'alahum khazanatuhā alam ya'tikum nadhīr
9. Qālū balā qad jā'anā nadhīrun fakadhdhabnā wa qulnā mā nazzalal-Lāhu min shay'in in antum illā fī ḍalālin kabīr
10. Wa qālū law kunnā nasma'u aw na'qilu mā kunnā fī aṣḥābis-sa'īr
11. Fa'tarafū bidhambihim fasuḥqal-li-aṣḥābis-sa'īr

### English Translation
6. And for those who disbelieved in their Lord is the punishment of Hell, and wretched is the destination.
7. When they are thrown into it, they hear from it a [dreadful] inhaling while it boils up.
8. It almost bursts with rage. Every time a company is thrown into it, its keepers ask them, "Did there not come to you a warner?"
9. They will say, "Yes, a warner had come to us, but we denied and said, 'Allah has not sent down anything. You are not but in great error.'"
10. And they will say, "If only we had been listening or reasoning, we would not be among the companions of the Blaze."
11. And they will acknowledge their sins, so [it is] alienation for the companions of the Blaze.

### Commentary
This section describes the fate of those who reject faith in Allah. In stark contrast to the perfection of the heavens, Hell is portrayed as a place of torment and regret.

Verse 6 establishes that Hell is specifically prepared for those who disbelieve in their Lord, and it is described as "the worst destination." The following verses provide a vivid, almost sensory description of Hell: it makes terrifying sounds as it boils and nearly bursts with rage against the disbelievers - attributing emotional qualities to Hell itself.

A significant dialogue is presented in verses 8-10. The keepers of Hell question each new group about whether they received warning during their worldly life. This establishes Allah's justice - punishment only comes after clear warning. The disbelievers admit that warners came to them, but they rejected the message and accused the messengers of error.

Their confession in verse 10 is particularly poignant: they acknowledge that if they had truly listened or used their reason, they would have avoided this fate. This emphasizes personal responsibility and the importance of rational engagement with divine guidance.

The passage concludes with the disbelievers' acknowledgment of their sins, followed by a declaration of their alienation from Allah's mercy. The word "suḥqan" (alienation/removal) indicates the spiritual distance between the sinners and divine compassion.

These verses serve as a warning to the audience while establishing the justice of Allah's judgment - punishment follows clear warning and is the result of conscious rejection, not ignorance.

## Verses 12-15: The Reward of the Believers and Allah's Knowledge

### Arabic
إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَخْشَوْنَ رَبَّهُم بِالْغَيْبِ لَهُم مَّغْفِرَةٌ وَأَجْرٌ كَبِيرٌ ﴿١٢﴾ وَأَسِرُّوا قَوْلَكُمْ أَوِ اجْهَرُوا بِهِ ۖ إِنَّهُ عَلِيمٌ بِذَاتِ الصُّدُورِ ﴿١٣﴾ أَلَا يَعْلَمُ مَنْ خَلَقَ وَهُوَ اللَّطِيفُ الْخَبِيرُ ﴿١٤﴾ هُوَ الَّذِي جَعَلَ لَكُمُ الْأَرْضَ ذَلُولًا فَامْشُوا فِي مَنَاكِبِهَا وَكُلُوا مِن رِّزْقِهِ ۖ وَإِلَيْهِ النُّشُورُ ﴿١٥﴾

### Transliteration
12. Innal-ladhīna yakhshawna Rabbahum bil-ghaybi lahum-maghfiratunw-wa ajrun kabīr
13. Wa asirrū qawlakum awijharū bih, innahū 'Alīmum bi-dhātiṣ-ṣudūr
14. Alā ya'lamu man khalaqa wa Huwal-Laṭīful-Khabīr
15. Huwal-ladhī ja'ala lakumul-arḍa dhalūlan famshū fī manākibihā wa kulū mir-rizqih, wa ilayhin-nushūr

### English Translation
12. Indeed, those who fear their Lord unseen will have forgiveness and great reward.
13. And conceal your speech or publicize it; indeed, He is Knowing of that within the breasts.
14. Does He who created not know, while He is the Subtle, the Acquainted?
15. It is He who made the earth tame for you - so walk among its slopes and eat of His provision - and to Him is the resurrection.

### Commentary
After describing the fate of disbelievers, the surah shifts to the believers and Allah's complete knowledge. Verse 12 presents the counterpart to the punishment described earlier: those who fear Allah "in the unseen" (without seeing Him) will receive forgiveness and a great reward. This "fear" (khashya) is not terror but a reverent awareness that influences behavior.

Verse 13 emphasizes Allah's complete knowledge - whether one speaks openly or secretly, Allah knows what is in the hearts. This serves both as a warning against hypocrisy and as comfort for the sincere believer whose inner devotion is known to Allah.

Verse 14 presents a rhetorical question with obvious implications: Of course the Creator knows His creation intimately. Allah is described as both Latif (Subtle, aware of finest details) and Khabir (Acquainted with everything), emphasizing the comprehensiveness of divine knowledge.

Verse 15 shifts to Allah's benevolence in making the earth "tame" or "subservient" (dhalūl) for humanity. This indicates the habitability of Earth and its suitability for human life. People are invited to travel through the land and enjoy Allah's provision, but with the reminder that ultimately they will return to Him for judgment. This connects the privilege of living on Earth with the responsibility of using that life properly, knowing resurrection awaits.

This section balances the previous portrayal of Allah's judgment with His mercy and provision, while emphasizing His complete knowledge of all things, including the innermost thoughts of people.

## Verses 16-19: Allah's Power to Punish and His Signs

### Arabic
أَأَمِنتُم مَّن فِي السَّمَاءِ أَن يَخْسِفَ بِكُمُ الْأَرْضَ فَإِذَا هِيَ تَمُورُ ﴿١٦﴾ أَمْ أَمِنتُم مَّن فِي السَّمَاءِ أَن يُرْسِلَ عَلَيْكُمْ حَاصِبًا ۖ فَسَتَعْلَمُونَ كَيْفَ نَذِيرِ ﴿١٧﴾ وَلَقَدْ كَذَّبَ الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ فَكَيْفَ كَانَ نَكِيرِ ﴿١٨﴾ أَوَلَمْ يَرَوْا إِلَى الطَّيْرِ فَوْقَهُمْ صَافَّاتٍ وَيَقْبِضْنَ ۚ مَا يُمْسِكُهُنَّ إِلَّا الرَّحْمَٰنُ ۚ إِنَّهُ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ بَصِيرٌ ﴿١٩﴾

### Transliteration
16. A-amintum man fis-samā'i ay-yakhsifa bikumul-arḍa fa-idhā hiya tamūr
17. Am amintum man fis-samā'i ay-yursila 'alaykum ḥāṣibā, fasata'lamūna kayfa nadhīr
18. Wa laqad kadhdhabal-ladhīna min qablihim fakayfa kāna nakīr
19. Awalam yaraw ilaṭ-ṭayri fawqahum ṣāffātin wa yaqbiḍn, mā yumsikuhunna illar-Raḥmān, innahū bikulli shay'im-Baṣīr

### English Translation
16. Do you feel secure that He who [holds authority] in the heaven would not cause the earth to swallow you and suddenly it would sway?
17. Or do you feel secure that He who [holds authority] in the heaven would not send against you a storm of stones? Then you would know how [severe] was My warning.
18. And already had those before them denied, and how [terrible] was My reproach.
19. Do they not see the birds above them with wings outspread and [sometimes] folded in? None holds them [aloft] except the Most Merciful. Indeed He is, of all things, Seeing.

### Commentary
This section issues powerful warnings about Allah's ability to punish, while also presenting natural signs of His power and mercy.

Verses 16-17 contain pointed rhetorical questions that challenge a false sense of security: Do people feel safe from Allah causing the earth to swallow them or sending a violent storm against them? The phrase "He who is in the heaven" emphasizes Allah's transcendence and authority over creation. These verses remind people of their vulnerability before divine power, despite the earth being made "tame" for them as mentioned earlier.

Verse 18 references previous nations that denied their messengers and suffered divine punishment, serving as a historical warning to the current audience. The word "nakīr" (reproach/punishment) indicates the severe consequences of such denial.

The tone shifts in verse 19, which directs attention to birds flying overhead with wings spread or folded. This everyday sight is presented as a sign of Allah's power and mercy - it is the Most Merciful (ar-Rahman) who keeps the birds aloft. This verse follows the warnings with a reminder of Allah's sustaining power in nature, balancing fear with appreciation of divine mercy. It concludes by reiterating Allah's complete awareness - He sees all things.

These verses maintain the surah's balance between warnings of Allah's power to punish and reminders of His sustaining mercy, while encouraging contemplation of natural signs that point to divine control of the universe.

## Verses 20-30: Allah's Provision, Challenges to Disbelievers, and the Ultimate Decision

### Arabic
أَمَّنْ هَٰذَا الَّذِي هُوَ جُندٌ لَّكُمْ يَنصُرُكُم مِّن دُونِ الرَّحْمَٰنِ ۚ إِنِ الْكَافِرُونَ إِلَّا فِي غُرُورٍ ﴿٢٠﴾ أَمَّنْ هَٰذَا الَّذِي يَرْزُقُكُمْ إِنْ أَمْسَكَ رِزْقَهُ ۚ بَل لَّجُّوا فِي عُتُوٍّ وَنُفُورٍ ﴿٢١﴾ أَفَمَن يَمْشِي مُكِبًّا عَلَىٰ وَجْهِهِ أَهْدَىٰ أَمَّن يَمْشِي سَوِيًّا عَلَىٰ صِرَاطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ ﴿٢٢﴾ قُلْ هُوَ الَّذِي أَنشَأَكُمْ وَجَعَلَ لَكُمُ السَّمْعَ وَالْأَبْصَارَ وَالْأَفْئِدَةَ ۖ قَلِيلًا مَّا تَشْكُرُونَ ﴿٢٣﴾ قُلْ هُوَ الَّذِي ذَرَأَكُمْ فِي الْأَرْضِ وَإِلَيْهِ تُحْشَرُونَ ﴿٢٤﴾ وَيَقُولُونَ مَتَىٰ هَٰذَا الْوَعْدُ إِن كُنتُمْ صَادِقِينَ ﴿٢٥﴾ قُلْ إِنَّمَا الْعِلْمُ عِندَ اللَّهِ وَإِنَّمَا أَنَا نَذِيرٌ مُّبِينٌ ﴿٢٦﴾ فَلَمَّا رَأَوْهُ زُلْفَةً سِيئَتْ وُجُوهُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا وَقِيلَ هَٰذَا الَّذِي كُنتُم بِهِ تَدَّعُونَ ﴿٢٧﴾ قُلْ أَرَأَيْتُمْ إِنْ أَهْلَكَنِيَ اللَّهُ وَمَن مَّعِيَ أَوْ رَحِمَنَا فَمَن يُجِيرُ الْكَافِرِينَ مِنْ عَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ ﴿٢٨﴾ قُلْ هُوَ الرَّحْمَٰنُ آمَنَّا بِهِ وَعَلَيْهِ تَوَكَّلْنَا ۖ فَسَتَعْلَمُونَ مَنْ هُوَ فِي ضَلَالٍ مُّبِينٍ ﴿٢٩﴾ قُلْ أَرَأَيْتُمْ إِنْ أَصْبَحَ مَاؤُكُمْ غَوْرًا فَمَن يَأْتِيكُم بِمَاءٍ مَّعِينٍ ﴿٣٠﴾

### English Translation
20. Or who is it that could be an army for you to aid you other than the Most Merciful? The disbelievers are not but in delusion.
21. Or who is it that could provide for you if He withheld His provision? But they have persisted in insolence and aversion.
22. Then is one who walks fallen on his face better guided or one who walks erect on a straight path?
23. Say, "It is He who has produced you and made for you hearing and vision and hearts; little are you grateful."
24. Say, "It is He who has multiplied you throughout the earth, and to Him you will be gathered."
25. And they say, "When is this promise, if you should be truthful?"
26. Say, "The knowledge is only with Allah, and I am only a clear warner."
27. But when they see it approaching, the faces of those who disbelieve will be distressed, and it will be said, "This is that for which you used to call."
28. Say, [O Muhammad], "Have you considered: whether Allah should cause my death and those with me or have mercy upon us, who can protect the disbelievers from a painful punishment?"
29. Say, "He is the Most Merciful; we have believed in Him, and upon Him we have relied. And you will [come to] know who it is that is in clear error."
30. Say, "Have you considered: if your water was to become sunken [into the earth], then who could bring you flowing water?"

### Commentary
This final section continues challenging disbelievers while affirming Allah's provision and the Prophet's role.

Verses 20-21 ask pointed rhetorical questions: Who can help the disbelievers against Allah? Who can provide sustenance if Allah withholds it? These questions highlight the absolute dependence of all beings on Allah. The disbelievers are described as being in delusion (ghurūr) and persisting in arrogance and aversion.

Verse 22 presents a vivid contrast between someone walking fallen on his face (symbolizing confusion and misguidance) versus someone walking upright on a straight path (representing guidance and certainty). This metaphor illustrates the difference between disbelief and faith.

Verses 23-24 direct the Prophet to emphasize Allah's creative power - He created humans and gave them faculties of hearing, sight, and understanding. Yet, people show little gratitude. Allah has multiplied humanity throughout the earth, and to Him they will return for judgment.

Verses 25-27 address the disbelievers' skeptical question about when the promised judgment will occur. The Prophet is instructed to affirm that this knowledge belongs only to Allah, while his own role is simply to warn clearly. The passage then jumps forward to describe the scene when judgment actually approaches - the faces of disbelievers will be distressed as they confront what they had denied.

Verse 28 presents a powerful argument: Whether Allah causes the death of the Prophet and believers or shows them mercy, this does not change the inevitable punishment awaiting disbelievers. No one can protect them from Allah's punishment.

Verse 29 affirms the believers' faith in the Most Merciful and their reliance on Him, while warning that eventually everyone will know who was truly in error.

The surah concludes in verse 30 with a final reflection on Allah's provision - if water were to disappear into the earth, who could restore it? This powerful closing reminder of dependence on Allah for the most basic necessity of life reinforces the surah's main themes of divine sovereignty, power, and provision.
