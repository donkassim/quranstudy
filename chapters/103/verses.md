### Commentary
This remarkable short surah contains just three verses but encompasses a comprehensive worldview and prescription for human success.

The surah begins with Allah swearing by time (al-'asr), which can refer to time in general, a specific period like the afternoon, or the passage of history. This oath emphasizes the significance of time as witness to humanity's condition. Time is the container in which human life unfolds, and its passage reveals the consequences of our choices.

The second verse presents a stark assessment: humankind is fundamentally in a state of loss. This loss refers to the diminishment of one's life capital - as time passes, we lose our youth, health, opportunities, and ultimately our lives. Without a proper orientation toward existence, people invest their limited time in pursuits that yield no lasting benefit, resulting in the ultimate loss on the Day of Judgment.

The third verse provides the exception to this universal condition of loss, outlining four interconnected qualities that together constitute the path to success:

1. **Faith (Iman)**: Belief in Allah and the teachings revealed through His messengers. This is the foundation for a purposeful existence.

2. **Righteous Deeds (Amal Salih)**: Faith must be actualized through actions that benefit oneself and others, in accordance with divine guidance.

3. **Mutual Encouragement to Truth (Tawaasi bil-Haqq)**: Beyond individual faith and action, believers must support one another in adhering to truth and justice. This creates a community committed to upholding divine values.

4. **Mutual Encouragement to Patience (Tawaasi bis-Sabr)**: Perseverance in faith and righteous action in the face of challenges, hardships, and temptations. This ensures continuity and steadfastness in the other elements.

Imam Shafi'i famously said that if people deeply reflected on this surah alone, it would be sufficient guidance for them. Its brilliance lies in its concise yet comprehensive nature - it identifies humanity's fundamental problem (being in loss due to the passage of time without proper investment of one's life) and provides the complete solution (the four-part formula for success).

The surah is also notable for its emphasis on both individual and collective responsibility. The path to salvation requires not only personal faith and action but also mutual support and encouragement within a community. This highlights the social nature of Islamic practice and the importance of building supportive environments for righteousness.

The mention of "truth" (haqq) and "patience" (sabr) as specific areas for mutual encouragement is significant. Truth encompasses all aspects of reality, ethical conduct, and justice, while patience is necessary for maintaining commitment to these principles despite difficulties. Together, they represent both the what (truth) and the how (patience) of sustaining faith and righteous action over time.
