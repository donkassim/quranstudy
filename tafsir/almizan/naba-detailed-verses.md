# Al-Mizan Detailed Commentary on Surah An-Naba (Verses 19-28)

## Introduction

This file contains detailed analysis from Allamah Tabatabai's Al-Mizan tafsir on verses 19-28 of Surah An-Naba, which describe key events of the Day of Judgment and the specific nature of hellfire. Tabatabai explores both the literal meanings and deeper philosophical implications of these verses.

## Verses 19-20: The Beginning of Judgment

> **"And the heaven shall be opened, and it will become as gates."** (19)
> **"And the mountains shall be set in motion and become as a mirage."** (20)

### Tabatabai's Analysis

According to Tabatabai, these verses describe the fundamental transformation of physical reality at the commencement of judgment:

- The "opening" of heaven represents the removal of barriers between the seen and unseen realms
- The metaphor of "gates" suggests new pathways of perception and understanding becoming accessible
- Mountains, symbols of stability and permanence in this world, become unstable and illusory
- The term "mirage" (sarab) is particularly significant, suggesting not just physical movement but ontological transformation

Tabatabai notes that these verses illustrate how resurrection involves not merely reconstituting bodies but a complete reordering of reality itself. The laws of nature as we understand them will be fundamentally altered.

## Verses 21-23: The Reality of Hell

> **"Surely hell lies in wait,"** (21)
> **"A place of resort for the rebellious,"** (22)
> **"They shall abide therein for ages."** (23)

### Tabatabai's Analysis

Tabatabai explores several dimensions of these verses:

- Hell described as "lying in wait" (mirsad) suggests it is vigilant and prepared, personifying divine justice
- The term "rebellious" (taghin) refers specifically to those who transgressed proper bounds in relation to God and fellow creatures
- "Abiding for ages" (labithina fiha ahqaba) indicates extended duration without specifying eternality
- The use of "ahqab" (ages/long periods) raises questions about the temporality of punishment

The philosophical implications Tabatabai draws include:

- Hell as a manifestation of the inner reality of rebellion against divine order
- The relationship between time in this world and in the hereafter
- The purpose of punishment as both justice and purification
- The correspondence between the nature of transgression and its consequence

## Verses 24-26: The Nature of Punishment

> **"They shall taste therein neither coolness nor drink,"** (24)
> **"Except boiling water and pus;"** (25)
> **"A fitting recompense."** (26)

### Tabatabai's Analysis

Tabatabai offers profound insights on these verses:

- The deprivation of "coolness" (bard) and "drink" (sharab) represents both physical and spiritual deprivation
- The exception of "boiling water" (hamim) and "pus" (ghassaq) represents the transformation of what should nourish into what harms
- The term "fitting recompense" (jaza'an wifaqa) establishes the principle of correspondence between deeds and consequences
- These descriptions are both literal and representative of spiritual realities

Tabatabai notes the philosophical principle at work:

- The punishment bears intrinsic relationship to the sin rather than being arbitrary
- What one experiences in the hereafter is a manifestation of one's own actions
- Divine justice operates through natural consequences rather than imposed penalties
- The term "wifaq" (fitting/corresponding) indicates perfect proportionality

## Verses 27-28: The Root Cause

> **"Surely they feared not the reckoning,"** (27)
> **"And rejected Our communications with strong rejection."** (28)

### Tabatabai's Analysis

Tabatabai identifies these verses as revealing the fundamental causes of punishment:

- The absence of "fear of reckoning" (la yarjuna hisaba) indicates not mere disbelief but a willful disregard
- The term "rejected" (kadhdhabu) involves active denial rather than passive ignorance
- The emphasis on "strong rejection" (kidhdhaba) indicates intensity and persistence in denial
- These verses establish the psychological and spiritual roots of transgression

The philosophical dimensions Tabatabai explores include:

- The relationship between awareness of accountability and moral behavior
- How denial becomes self-reinforcing through "strong rejection"
- The freedom of will implied in choosing to reject clear signs
- The justice of consequences flowing from conscious decisions

## Integration with Divine Attributes

Tabatabai connects these verses to a broader understanding of divine attributes:

- Justice ('adl): The perfect correspondence between deeds and consequences
- Wisdom (hikmah): The purposefulness of both warning and punishment
- Mercy (rahmah): Even in punishment, there is purpose rather than mere vengeance
- Sovereignty (mulk): Ultimate control over the final outcome of all affairs

## Practical Implications

From these verses, Tabatabai derives several practical insights:

1. The importance of cultivating awareness of accountability (hisab)
2. Understanding that current actions shape one's ultimate reality
3. The need to recognize and accept divine communications (ayat)
4. The danger of persistent denial becoming a self-reinforcing pattern
5. The relationship between inner attitude and outward consequences

## Linguistic and Rhetorical Analysis

Tabatabai also examines the rhetorical power of these verses:

- The vivid imagery creates immediate psychological impact
- The progression from cosmic transformation to personal consequence is carefully structured
- The balanced rhythm emphasizes the inevitability of judgment
- The use of active participles (mirsad, labithina) creates a sense of ongoing reality
- The contrast between what is sought (coolness, drink) and what is found (boiling water, pus) heightens the emotional impact
